Low-level manipulations with GIT repository
=============

Create commit with the following content:
```
dir1/
  foo.txt:
    Contents of foo!
  bar.png:
    <png content>
```                

> Git commit should be created without using `git commit` command.
Objects should be placed into the repository manually. There are special commands for this.

> Results are git repository pushed to GitHub and log with commands you have issued.
